# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Jait is a Bun/TypeScript monorepo.
- `packages/gateway`: Fastify gateway, tools, surfaces, security, scheduler, memory, DB.
- `packages/shared`: shared schemas, constants, and domain types.
- `packages/api-client`: typed client used by apps.
- `apps/web`: Vite + React frontend.
- `e2e`: Playwright end-to-end tests.
- `docker/` + `docker-compose.yml`: container builds and local stack.

Prefer placing new domain logic in `packages/*/src` and keeping UI concerns in `apps/web/src`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run from repository root unless noted.
- `bun install --frozen-lockfile`: install workspace dependencies.
- `bun run dev`: start workspace dev processes.
- `bun run build`: build all workspaces.
- `bun run typecheck`: strict TypeScript checks.
- `bun run test`: run Vitest unit/integration tests.
- `bun run lint`: run `oxlint` across repo.
- `cd e2e && npm test`: run Playwright suite.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: TypeScript (ES modules, strict mode).
- Indentation: 2 spaces; keep existing quote style per package.
- File names: kebab-case for modules (for example `consent-manager.ts`).
- Components: PascalCase for React component files and exports.
- Prefer explicit, descriptive names (`sessionService`, not `ss`).
- Keep shared contracts in `packages/shared` and reuse instead of duplicating types.

## Testing Guidelines
- Unit tests: colocate as `*.test.ts` under `packages/*/src` or `apps/*/src`.
- E2E tests: place specs in `e2e/tests/*.spec.ts`.
- Add tests for new tools/routes/schemas and regression fixes.
- Before opening a PR, run: `bun run typecheck && bun run test` (and E2E when UI behavior changes).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow Conventional Commit style seen in history: `feat: ...`, `fix(gateway): ...`, `chore: ...`.
- Keep commits focused and small; avoid mixing refactors with feature changes.
- PRs should include: concise summary, linked issue (if any), test evidence, and screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.
- Call out config or migration impacts explicitly (env vars, DB schema, Docker changes).

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Copy `.env.example` for local setup; never commit secrets.
- Treat high-impact tools (terminal, file writes, OS/service control) as consent-sensitive paths.
- Keep path boundaries and SSRF protections intact when adding new tools or surfaces.
